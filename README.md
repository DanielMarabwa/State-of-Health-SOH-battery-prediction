# State-of-Health-SOH-battery-prediction
The State of Health (SOH) of a battery indicates how its current capacity compares to when it was new. For example, if a battery originally lasted 10 hours but lasts only 7 hours after two years of use, its SOH is 70%. In this project, researchers simulated battery usage of time, and machine learning models are used to predict SOH.
